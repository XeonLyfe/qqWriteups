## Initial findings

While first looking through the RusherHack loader, I noticed a class named rusherhack/$$i that extended URLClassLoader

This was interesting to me as it contained 2 seperate HashMap's which could potentially contain the classes/resources used by the utility mod. 
Along with this was a Cipher field, possibly introducing some type of encryption?

## Further digging into $$i

Using some tools and reflection to look into these HashMaps, I see that the key type of both HashMap's are a String and the value is a byte array!

Only issue is that the byte array seems to be encrypting after trying to print out a resource's contents as a string...

## Getting an instance of the class for reflection

Due to most of the fields including the HashMap's not being static, we need an instance of the class in order to access them.  
To accomplish this, I simply added a static field with the type being the $$i class and adding the following bytecode before the return in the $$i class as the $$i class only has an instance of it created once in MixinLauncher.init()V. 

```
ALOAD this
PUTSTATIC rusherhack/$$i.daClazz Lrusherhack/$$i;
```

- Now I can simply use this field to access the rest of the fields in $$i!

## The getResourceAsStream trick

Further investigation of the $$i class uncovers this method named "getResourceAsStream".

The method takes in a string and returns an InputStream, however, it contains cryptography related exceptions meaning it could possibly be doing encryption/decryption on whatevers passing through the stream.  

I tested this by iterating through the resource map ($$f field) and passing through every key and taking the return value and reading the bytes then writing it to a file.  

And the results..?
